Exercise 1: Polynomial interpolation/approximation 
	lab2e1.m
	 (require function file: polynomial_interp.m)
	
	if m is small, a relatively small n can make the polynomial fit
	(for exmaple, for m=0.5, n=4 can get a good fit with error 0.0214,but for m=3, n=4 can not get a good fit and the erro is 16.8878)
	
	for any m:
	when degree n is small, the ploynomial does not fit well, and the error is big
	when degree n becomes very big, we cant see the change in error(for example,for m=3, n=100 and n=1000 both have error 2.6428e-08)

	And the error between the interpolated y value and the ground-truth on X seems always smaller than the error between the interpolated y and the ground-truth on X_new.

	If the n is big enough, the polynomial compare with the true sin function inbetween sample points is almost the same.
	But the polynomial compare with the true sin function Outside the samples interval is quite different.
